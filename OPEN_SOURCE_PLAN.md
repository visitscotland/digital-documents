## Introduction  

This document outlines VisitScotlandâ€™s plan to publish internal code as open source.  The desire to code in respect to open source in the first instance is built upon the foundational guidance by the UK Government and The Scottish Government Digital First Assessment. 

### Open Source Licence 

Where possible, the MIT licence should be employed as the defacto licence going forward.  It is short, to the point and optimised for development.  It gives users express permission to reuse code for any purpose, sometimes even if code is part of proprietary software. As long as users include the original copy of the MIT license in their distribution, they can make any changes or modifications to the code to suit their own needs [What is the MIT Licence?, Snyk.io, https://snyk.io/learn/what-is-mit-license].  It is in the spirit of transparent Open Government to encourage reuse but also the ability to adapt code to make it fit for purpose. 

### Repository Template 

All open source repositories should include the following files: 

README 

The readme should highlight the Open Source nature of the software 

LICENCE.md 

Direct copy of the MIT licence.  Add any disclaimer to this file for third party libraries that may not be open source by necessity. E.g. This solution is based upon the commercial version of Bloomreach Experience Manager and as a result the original non-open license is respected where applicable. 

CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md 

Alongside code of conduct template, ensure net@visitscotland.net is mentioned as our primary security contact 

CONTRIBUTING.md 

A file to outline the process for any open source contributors.
