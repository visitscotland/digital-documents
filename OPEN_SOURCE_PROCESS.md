# For VisitScotland Developers

PROCESS

1. Review the submitted issue in github.com/<name_of_repo>/issues.
2. As a first sterespond to the submitter and acknowledge their contribution.
3. Ask yourself, does it make sense, do you need to clarify before making a call on whether the issue needs to be escalated.

## Types of Issues

### Bugs
Can you replicate the bug?  If so, verify the same result with a colleague and ask the test team to assist if it's a specific device bug.  If not, ask the submitter for more detail and use a service such as https://www.whatsmybrowser.org/ to gather more information

### Documentation
Documentation changes are ususally made if there is a lack of clarity or important information in the README or additional docs.  Use common sense to action the change yourself if you can.

### Duplicate
An issue might be a duplicate, they should be tagged as such and escalated with the development teams.

### Enhancement
Read the enhancement and submit it into our internal system for review and prioritization.

### Question
Can you answer the question without pulling in extra resource!?  Contact helpdesk if the question is related to the wider organisation.
