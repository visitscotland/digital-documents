# VisitScotland Digital Teams Open Source Coding Policy

1.  **Introduction**
    
    1.  [Open Source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)
        software is software with source code that anyone can inspect,
        modify, and enhance.
    
    2.  [Coding in the
        Open](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/09/04/the-benefits-of-coding-in-the-open/)
        is the principle where code is open sourced, such that it can be
        reviewed by external parties.
    
    3.  As part of Scottish Government Open Source and Open Standard
        [Policy
        Strategy](https://resources.mygov.scot/standards/policy-strategy/#open-source-and-open-standards)
        document *‘Where software is produced in-house by the Scottish
        public sector, or through publicly funded research and
        development projects, consideration should be given to making
        this available as Open source software‘*.
    
    4.  According to [Digital
        First](https://resources.mygov.scot/standards/digital-first/)
        Service Standards, *we should also ‘Make all new source code
        open and reusable, and publish it under appropriate licences (or
        provide a convincing explanation as to why this cannot be done
        for specific subsets of the source code)’.*
    
    5.  It is a requirement of the Digital First Service Standard’s to
        have an Open Source Coding Policy.

2.  **Purpose and Scope**
    
    1.  This policy will cover the Open Source Policy including the
        legal policy.
    
    2.  Implementation of this policy will be detailed in the Open
        Source Plan document.
    
    3.  For new digital codebases, we’ll be taking a “coding in the
        open” approach, which will improve collaboration and knowledge
        sharing. Making source code open and reusable is one of the
        [Government Design
        Principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles),
        and GDS (Government Digital Service) notes that this approach
        has a number of benefits, including enabling shared learnings.
    
    4.  The files in question may be sanitised to remove key data such
        as software/service version information or third party SAAS
        access keys that could reveal sensitive configuration options
        that makes our system vulnerable to outside manipulation. This
        will give third parties full visibility of the source code where
        they can use our solutions in their own projects and perhaps
        even collaborate or contribute, if appropriate.

3.  **Policy Statement, Commitment & Responsibilities**
    
    1.  An Open Source Steering Group will be created to review and
        guide VisitScotland staff on implementation of this process. Their role
        will be to periodically review this policy document and the
        progress of its implementation.
    
    2.  VisitScotland staff will open source all new digital projects. To
        accomplish this, we'll be publishing our source code to
        [GitHub](https://github.com/) and applying an open source
        [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
        [license](https://opensource.org/licenses).
    
    3.  A process will be put in place to assess security considerations
        and ensure that any sensitive parts of the source code, such as
        keys to external and internal APIs, will not be published.
    
    4.  VisitScotland will ensure that relevant training is provided to support 
        staff in the implementation of this policy and ensure that the
        creation of required processes is put in place and followed.
    
    5.  The UI Developers and Software Engineering teams will be
        required to implement this policy, with help from a wider
        technical team. Implementation will be required by Scrum teams.

4.  **Principles & Legislative Framework**
    
    1.  The general principle of [Coding in the
        Open](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/09/04/the-benefits-of-coding-in-the-open/)
        will apply to this policy document.
    
    2.  The [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
        [license](https://opensource.org/licenses) will be the select
        license for this policy.
    
    3.  Following [Digital
        First](https://resources.mygov.scot/standards/digital-first/)
        Service Standards.

5.  **Relationship to other VisitScotland Policies**
    
    1.  Any project that open sources its code should follow our
        Cybersecurity processes and protocols.

6.  **Training**
    
    1.  We are currently looking at what training will be required for
        this policy, this will be review by the Steering Group.

7.  **Monitoring and Review**
    
    1.  A Working Group of Software Engineers, UI Developers and WebOps
        will convene every 3 months to review implementation.
    
    2.  If Scottish Government changes policy with regards to Open
        Source then we will review more actively.

Forms, plans or procedures can be appended to the policy to aid
updating.
