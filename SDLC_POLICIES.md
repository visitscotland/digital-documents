Software Development Lifecycle Policies
====================================

In VisitScotland, ensuring our software is safe and reliable is crucial. The Policy Section lays out clear guidelines 
for our developers or collaborators to follow. These guidelines help us all work together to keep our software secure 
and protect it from potential problems.

This section explains the practices developers should use throughout the software development process. It's meant to fit 
smoothly into our work, making sure we balance strong security with the flexibility needed for creativity.

By working together and following these guidelines, we can create software that meets high standards of security and 
quality.
