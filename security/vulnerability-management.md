Vulnerability Management Policy
===============================

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish a standardised approach to identify, assess, and remediate code 
vulnerabilities in a timely manner. This policy aims to protect our systems, data, and users from potential security 
threats while minimising the impact on the development process.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all software development projects, including web applications, backend services, etc.  developed 
or maintained by VisitScotland. It encompasses all stages of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), from initial 
design through deployment and maintenance.

## 3. Definitions
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness in the code that can be exploited to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or 
  availability of the system.
- **Remediation**: The process of fixing a vulnerability.
- **Waive**: Rule to ignore a vulnerability for a specific amount of time
- **Severity Levels**: Classification of vulnerabilities based on their potential impact.

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities
- **Developers:** Responsible for writing secure code, conducting initial testing, and fixing identified vulnerabilities.
- **Project Managers:** Responsible for ensuring that vulnerabilities are addressed and review waivers for 
  vulnerabilities in accordance with this policy

## 5. Classification of Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities will be classified into four severity levels:
- **Critical**: Immediate action required. These vulnerabilities can lead to complete system compromise, significant 
  data breach/loss.
- **High**: Must be addressed as soon as possible. These can lead to major security breaches.
- **Medium**: Should be fixed within a reasonable timeframe. These can potentially be exploited but are not as severe.
- **Low**: Minor issues that should be resolved in the regular course of development.

## 6. Identification of Vulnerabilities
The following mechanism will be used identify potential vulnerabilities
- **IDE Tools**: Developer's IDE will be the first gate to identify potential vulnerabilities through static analysis 
  or dependency scan
- **Manual Code Reviews**: Developers will conduct regular manual code reviews to identify and raise any potential 
  security concerns.
- **Automated Scanning**: Automated tools will run on schedule or on commit actions, performing scans and triggering 
  notifications
- **External Audits**: Engage third-party security experts to conduct periodic security assessments.

## 7. Remediation Process
1. **Identification**: Identify the vulnerability and whether it impacts a public-facing application.
2. **Assessment**: Assess the impact of the vulnerability if it were exploited and determine the severity.
3. **Prioritization**: Prioritization of the investigation and potential remediation depending on the severity. In some 
   cases the developers might be able to determine that their implementation is not exploitable instead of removing the 
   vulnerability
4. **Remediation Plan**: A remediation plan is developed, including a timeline for addressing the vulnerability. For 
   critical vulnerabilities some actions might need to be taken (such as temporarily disable a service)
5. **Fix Implementation**: Developers implement the fixes as per the remediation plan. For high and critical 
   vulnerabilities, immediate action is taken and a hotfix release might be required.
6. **Verification**: The security team verifies the fix to ensure the vulnerability is effectively mitigated.
7. **Deployment**: The fix is deployed following standard deployment procedures.

## 8. Timelines for Remediation
*Note: The following timelines represent what VisitScotland aims for but might not be currently representative as not 
all the tools and processes might be in place*

- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: Must be fixed within 24 hours.
- **High Vulnerabilities**: Must be fixed within 2 weeks. (Sprint)
- **Medium Vulnerabilities**: Addressed in the next regular development cycle or within 3 months.
- **Low Vulnerabilities**: Addressed in the next regular development cycle or within 3 months.

## 9. Waivers and Exceptions
When a vulnerability is introduced by third party libraries or applications and cannot be removed, the developer should 
carry out an investigation to verify that the vulnerability cannot be exploited from our code.

Any waiver must be documented and approved by relevant project managers. Exceptions should only be granted if a strong 
justification is provided.

In those cases, we might need to put a waiver in our code to remove that  flag

- *1 year*: This is a false positive. However, there is a small risk that the use of this library changes, rendering it 
  a real risk. An annual review is advised to confirm we keep using the library in the same context.
- *6 months*: The current state and use of the library is not vulnerable.  However, we need to verify that we keep using
  the best practices.
- *3 months*: The vulnerability comes from a third party which has acknowledged it and verified that their code is not 
  vulnerable. We might need to wait for them to release a fix.

## 10. Monitoring and Improvement
- **Training and Awareness**: Provide ongoing training for developers and other relevant staff on secure coding 
  practices and emerging threats.
- **Policy Review**: This policy will be reviewed and updated annually or as needed to ensure its effectiveness.
- **Iterative approach**: This policy will be defined as an iterative approach to tackle vulnerabilities. VisitScotland 
  has numerous repositories and many of them might contain vulnerabilities due to the lack of maintenance. This process 
  will take place gradually and try to minimise the impact in the development cycle.

## 11. Compliance
Compliance with this policy is mandatory. Failure to comply with this policy will result in stricter processes
